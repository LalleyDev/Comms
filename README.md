## Description

This will be a self hosted chat application built in Svelte.

Topics to improve upon in this project:
1. Svelte
2. PostgreSQL

## Why?
I think this would be a great learning project that would include user auth, voice and chat implementation on top of the opportunity to learn Svelte.

## Current State
Will be started after [Money Math](https://github.com/LalleyDev/moneyMath/tree/main) is finished. 

Once finished the plan is to host this for myself and my friends.

## Contributing
Any recommendations are more than welcome as I am trying to learn.
